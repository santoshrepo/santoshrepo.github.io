									<h3>Types of accidents in Victoria Neighbourhood</h3>
									<p> The application was built in ​ R shiny​. HTML​ was also integrated with the

										types.
										Different types of graphs were created to contribute to the analysis of the
										accidents. For instance, a Stacked bar chart was plotted to understand the
										number of accidents in the Suburbs.</p>
